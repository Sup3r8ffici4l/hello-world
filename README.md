# hello-world
This is for practicing GitHub flow
I am a student and want to start putting in effort learning how to code. Currently I am learning to use windows terminal and it seems like GitHub is a valuable resource whe using Terminal. I have used R studio and ALICE programs for coding things to use with scientific data and ALICE was used to facilitate learning code. It had a GUI so coding could be basically drag and drop code to get graphics to do what the user wanted them to.
